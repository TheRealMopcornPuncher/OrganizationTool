As the name would suggest, this is an orgnizational tool to help you with deciding which tasks are more important than others. I decided to create this program since I struggle with prioritizing, and I figured that a decision
matrix would be more than sufficient to help me with deicding what tasks and goals I need to complete. The only issue to using the decision matrix? It's slow, and I needed something fast and efficient, so I created
this program to automate the process.

To use this program, simply run the executable (.exe), input your tasks, score them, and you'll get a list of tasks in decending order of importance.
